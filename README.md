# servant-multipart

This package adds support for file upload to the servant
ecosystem. It draws on ideas and code from several people
who participated in the (in)famous
[ticket #133](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/133)
on servant's issue tracker. Explanations and examples to be added
soon.
